# Create a class with a class attribute a; create an object from it and set 'a' directly using object.a = o. Does this change the class attribute?
class Demo:
    a = 4

o = Demo()
print(o.a) # Prints the class attribute as the instance attribute is not present
o.a = 0
print(o.a) # Prints the instance attribute as the instance attribute is present
print(Demo.a) # Prints the class attribute
